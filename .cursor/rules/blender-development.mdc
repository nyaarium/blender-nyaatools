# Blender Development

## Deploying changes

Command: `./dev_deploy.sh | grep ".py"`

After making changes, auto-run the command to deploy to Blender. Inform the user to reload the addon after calling it.

## Debugging across Windows/WSL filesystem boundaries

Blender runs on Windows, code workspace is in WSL.

### Write diagnostics as Windows paths

In Blender Python, have instrumentation write diagnostics to Windows %TEMP% path.

```python
# Writes to: C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Temp\...
log_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), ...)
```

### Read diagnostics as Linux paths

As the agent, you can read the diagnostics from Linux /mnt/ path. Tools like `read_file` or `grep` can access over filesystem boundary at: `/mnt/c/Users/{username}/AppData/Local/Temp/...`.

Don't ever use bash `find` command. Use `ls` if you need to list files.

### Cleanup logs before next `<reproduction_steps>`

After you read the diagnostics, delete it to reduce bloat during the next debug cycle.
