# Blender Development

## Deploying changes

Command: `./dev_deploy.sh | grep ".py"`

After making changes:

1. Auto-run the command to deploy to Blender.
2. Delete old logs to reduce bloat
3. Inform the user to reload the addon.

## Debugging across Windows/WSL filesystem boundaries

Blender runs on Windows, code workspace is in WSL.

### Write diagnostics from Windows into WSL

In Blender Python, write diagnostics to the workspace via the WSL network path so the agent can read them on Linux. Use `\\wsl$\Ubuntu-24.04\`.

```python
# Example: write to project .cursor/debug.log from Blender on Windows
log_path = r"\\wsl$\Ubuntu-24.04\home\nyaarium\blender-nyaatools\.cursor\debug.log"
with open(log_path, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(...)
```
