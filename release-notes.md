### Important Notes

> - Be sure to **restart Blender** after updating this addon. Not sure why it wont update without a restart. (issue #10)
>
> - Like much of other Blender operators, most of my buttons will open a **small panel** to the bottom left of your 3D viewport, where you can enter the settings.

### Release Notes

- Fixed a bad Merge & Export bug where armature would be deleted if you started in Pose Mode (#19)

- Fixed some bugs related to hidden collections (#19, #27)
