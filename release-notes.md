### Important Notes

> - Be sure to **restart Blender** after updating this addon. Not sure why it wont update without a restart. (issue #10)
>
> - Like most Blender operators, my buttons will open a **small panel** to the bottom left of your 3D viewport, where you can enter the settings. Expand it to configure settings.

### Release Notes

- Fixed a problem where Dissolve Bones would not work with mirrorable bones. (fixes #54)

- Some mocap utility functions for my personal stuff
