### Important Notes

> - Be sure to **restart Blender** after updating this addon. Not sure why it wont update without a restart. (issue #10)
>
> - Like most Blender operators, my buttons will open a **small panel** to the bottom left of your 3D viewport, where you can enter the settings. Expand it to configure settings.

### Release Notes

#### 🎉 Major rework to make "Merge & Export" less destructive (#29, #36)

❌ _In previous versions,_ I warned you **_NOT TO SAVE_** after pressing that dangerous "Merge & Export" button.

✅ _Now,_ you can safely press "Merge & Export", and then continue working. It performs the merge in a temporary Blender scene instead of your main scene.
