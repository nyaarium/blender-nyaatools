### Important Notes

> - Be sure to **restart Blender** after updating this addon. Not sure why it wont update without a restart. (issue #10)
>
> - Like most Blender operators, my buttons will open a **small panel** to the bottom left of your 3D viewport, where you can enter the settings. Expand it to configure settings.

### Release Notes

- Disabled Decimate and Outline buttons. Unstable.

  - **Decimate button** - Messes up on meshes with the "Apply modifier on object with shapekeys" function. I will need to rewrite that before enabling this button again.

  - **Outline button** - Hasn't worked in ages, and was a short term thing for my renders. I don't use it anymore.
