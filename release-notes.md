### Important Notes

> - Be sure to **restart Blender** after updating this addon. Not sure why it wont update without a restart. (issue #10)
>
> - Like most Blender operators, my buttons will open a **small panel** to the bottom left of your 3D viewport, where you can enter the settings. Expand it to configure settings.

### Release Notes

- Added a new operator to rename packed images to match their name in Blender. Good for grabbing textures from various folders and resaving them to 1 folder.
