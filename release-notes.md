### Important Notes

> - Be sure to **restart Blender** after updating this addon. Not sure why it wont update without a restart. (issue #10)
>
> - Like much of other Blender operators, most of my buttons will open a **small panel** to the bottom left of your 3D viewport, where you can enter the settings.

### Release Notes

- Improved Nyaa Normalization a bunch. Better finger bones detection, and A/T posing
