### Release Notes

Now renders the preview `icon.png`. To do this:

1. Set your scene output to 128x128
2. Place a camera down and position it
3. Pretty up your scene
4. Press the Voices of the Void export button

*(it will automatically ignore UCX colliders)*

Fixed:

- Oopsie, accidently left my code about treating **Emission Strength** `0` textures as black. Now it's back in.
