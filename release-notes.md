### Important Notes

> - Be sure to **restart Blender** after updating this addon. Not sure why it wont update without a restart. (issue #10)
>
> - Like most Blender operators, my buttons will open a **small panel** to the bottom left of your 3D viewport, where you can enter the settings. Expand it to configure settings.

### Release Notes

Couple of fixes for the **Rename** button for Pack/Unpack:

- Fixed an error relating to local paths.

- Fixed a bug where it would washout the colors of the image due to scene color management changes.
